\section{Overview}
This is the first installment in a series of extra practice problems to be completed throughout the year. This assignment will cover Partial derivatives and their interpretation, applications of the new chain rule, absolute extrema, and Lagrange multipliers. While this assignment is review to help solidify concepts before your exam, future assignments will include more problems that are outside of your comfort zone. If you don't know how to solve any of the problems, that's ok! These are not meant to be solved in a vacuum, please use any resource you can to solve these problems. And if you still can't work out the problems, come to me and we'll work it through together. \\\\
1) Find the equation of the tangent plane to $z = ln(2x+y)$ at $(-1,3)$
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
2) Compute $\frac{dz}{dx}$ for $z = xln(xy) + y^3, y=cos(x^2+1)$
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
3) Compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$ for $x^2sin(2y-5z) = 1+ycos(6zx)$
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
4) Find the absolute minimum and absolute maximum of $f(x,y) = 2x^2 - y^2 + 6y$ a solid disk of radius $4$
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
5) Find the maximum and minimum of $f(x,y,z) = 4y-2z$ subject to the constraints $2x-y-z=2$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
